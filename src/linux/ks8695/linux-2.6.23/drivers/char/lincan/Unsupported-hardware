If your hardware is currently not supported there are two things you can do:
1) Edit the file src/template.c
2) Send an email to arnaud@wanadoo.nl

If you choose to add the code yourself, all you have to do is edit the file
template.c. This file contains hardware specific template functions wich you can
edit to make the hardware work with the driver. When you have edited this file
you can simply load the driver with the module parameter hw=template and all
should work fine. IMO the functions in template.c are well commented and you 
should have little trouble in adding/changing the correct code. If it still 
doesn't work feel free to contact me at arnaud@wanadoo.nl. In case you've
sucessfully changed the template.c file, please send this file (no patches 
please) to me so I can extend the drivers supported hardware base.

If you don't have the skills to add/change the code yourself, feel free to 
contact me at arnaud@wanadoo.nl
